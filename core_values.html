    				<p>Ephesians 4:4-6 — one body and one Spirit, as you also were called in one expectation of your calling, one Master, one belief, one immersion, one Elohim and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. </p>
    				<p><a id="1"><strong>1</strong></a><strong> – Redeemed:</strong> 1 John 1:7—But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Yeshua Messiah His Son cleanses us from all sin. <br>
      					Romans 6:16— Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves servants for obedience, you are servants of the one whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? </p>
    				<p><a id="2"><strong>2 </strong></a><strong>– Community:</strong> Romans 12:4-5—For as we have many members in one body, but all members do not have the same function,  so we, the many, are one body in Messiah, and members each one of one another. <br>
      					Romans 12:10— In brotherly love, tenderly loving towards one another, in appreciation, giving preference to each other; </p>
    				<p><a id="3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong> – one God:</strong> Deuteronomy 6:4— Hear, O Yisraʼĕl: יהוה our Elohim, יהוה is one! <br>
      					John 1:1-5— In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Elohim, and the Word was Elohim. He was in the beginning with Elohim. All came to be through Him, and without Him not even one came to be that came to be. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. <br>
      					John 14:26 (the holy spirit is referred to as “He”) -  “But the Helper, the Set-apart Spirit, whom the Father shall send in My Name, He shall teach you all, and remind you of all that I said to you. <br>
      					Matthew 3:16-17 And having been immersed, Yeshua went up immediately from the water, and see, the heavens were opened, and He saw the Spirit of Elohim descending like a dove and coming upon Him, and see, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I did delight.” </p>
    				<p><a id="4"><strong>4 </strong></a><strong>– one Book:</strong> 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (at the time this was written it could only be talking about the “old” testament) - All Scripture is breathed by Elohim and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for setting straight, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of Elohim might be fitted, equipped for every good work.</p>
    				<p><a id="5"><strong>5</strong></a><strong> – one People:</strong> Colossians 3:10-11— and have put on the new one who is renewed in knowledge according to the likeness of Him who created him, where there is not Greek and Yehudite, circumcised and uncircumcised, foreigner, Scythian, slave, free, but Messiah is all, and in all. </p>
    				<p><a id="6"><strong>6 </strong></a><strong>– one House:</strong> Genesis 9:19  These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated. <br>
      					Genesis 10:6-11  The sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan. <br>
      					The sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, &quot;Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.&quot;   The beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.  From that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and Calah, <br>
      					Luke 11:32  &quot;The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.  (NASB)</p>
    				<p><a id="7"><strong>7 </strong></a><strong>– one Kitchen:</strong> Genesis 18:8— And he took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them, and he stood by them under the tree as they ate. </p>
    				<p><a id="8"><strong>8 </strong></a><strong>– one Messiah Yeshua:</strong> John 4:25-26— The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming, the One who is called Anointed. When that One comes, He shall announce to us all.” Yeshua said to her, “I who am speaking to you am He.”<br></p>
