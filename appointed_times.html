  				<h4 id="pdfLink">Click here for a <a href="pdf/The_Creators_holy_days.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a></h4>

  				<p style="text-align: center">As a group we keep only the biblical feasts. <br>
      				As a group we do not intentionally add mans traditions to His appointed times. <br>
      				As a group we follow His timing, the biblical (lunar) calendar.<br>
      				We do not list our celebrations publicly, for more information please visit in person.</p>
