We wanted to obey the bible for what it says, without comment or commentary that did not line up with the texts and the principle that Scripture interprets Scripture.  We came out of unbiblical practices that could not be justified by the Bible and left traditions behind, even though many times this was difficult.</p>   				<p>Along the way we discovered that God had never changed the 7th day for another day, and that He never did say “one day in seven.”  We started keeping the Sabbath as the Scripture teaches and began to realize that as followers of the Messiah Yeshua (the original Jesus) we are grafted into the Olive Tree and not a replacement for it.  We began discovering more, such as 1 John 2:3-6 which says:</p>  			 		<p>"And by this we may know that we know Him--if we obey His commands. He who professes to know Him, and yet does not obey His commands, is a liar, and the truth has no place in his heart. But whoever obeys His Message, in him love for God has in very deed reached perfection. By this we can know that we are in Him.  The man who professes to be continuing in Him is himself also bound to live as He lived."</p>   				<p>For some of us this was a radical thought -- to obey His commands as they apply to us today wherever we live, work and interact in our lives.  Some would say that we were going back under the Law, but we realized that that is where we are supposed to be if by being under the Law they meant obeying God.  Then we heard that we are to keep the commands of Yeshua but not the “Old Testament God” and  we learned that was wrong because that gave two gods. &nbsp;1 John spoke to us again in 5:2-3. &nbsp;</p><p>"<span style="font-size: 1em;">By this we know that we love the children of God, whenever we love God and keep His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments, and His commandments are not burdensome."</span></p>   				<p>Now it seems pretty simple.  If Yeshua and the Father are one, then their commands are one and obeying the one is obeying the other.  So, many of us started with Shabbat, and then we started learning to keep the Appointed Times, the feasts that belong to God and were put on loan to Israel (see Leviticus 23), and in our keeping and obeying we began to learn.  We found that it was not as much about what we thought as it is about what we are doing.</p>   				<p>So now we are on a journey, a journey of discovery and learning and the wonder of learning how to “live as He lived.”   Yeshua worshipped on Shabbat, He kept the Appointed Times, He never violated the Law - which we have learned is called Torah, or teaching/instruction.  But in the same way we left behind the traditions of the church which took us away from the Bible. &nbsp;We do not care to take up new traditions that would keep us away from the Bible.  So although we look Jewish sometimes because of when and how we meet, we are not attempting to be Jewish any more than we are trying to be anti-church.  We are just trying to be obedient children who are learning to imitate our Teacher Yeshua and to live pleasing to him.  We are on a journey, we have not arrived, we are learning and will continue to learn.  If you are on such a journey, come meet us some time.  We are easy to find.  We’re the Yeshua loving group that meets on Saturday.  Simply enough, that is why we call ourselves a Sabbath Fellowship.</p> 				</article> 			</div> 			<footer>   			<ul>     				<li><a href="index.shtml">Home</a></li>     				<li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>     				<li><a href="visitors.html">Visitors</a></li>     				<li><a href="live.html">Live</a></li>     				<li><a href="audio.php">Audio</a></li>     				<li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>   			</ul> 			</footer>	</div>		<!-- Google analytics -->	<script> 			(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ 				(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), 					m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) 				})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');  				ga('create', 'UA-48753604-1', 'sabbathfellowshiponline.org'); 				ga('send', 'pageview');	</script>
