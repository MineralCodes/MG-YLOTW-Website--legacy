    				<h2>CONSTITUTION OF YESHUA LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2>
    				<h3>SABBATH FELLOWSHIP<br><br></h3>

    				<h4 id="pdfLink">Click here for a <a href="pdf/Constitution.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></h4>

    				<p>PREAMBLE WHEREAS, it is the express purpose of God to call out of the world a people for His own possession who shall constitute the Body or Congregation of Adonai Yeshua, built and established upon the foundation of the Emissaries and Prophets, Messiah Yeshua Himself being the Chief Cornerstone; and</p>
    				<p>WHEREAS, God having ordained that this Universal Body should find its expression in and through local congregations calling them to assemble together for worship, fellowship, counsel, and instruction in the Word of God, for the work of the ministry and for the exercise of those spiritual gifts and offices provided for in the Brit Chadasha (New Covenant), therefore</p>
    				<p>BE IT RESOLVED, that we whose names appear on the Congregational Roster, as of this date, do recognize ourselves as a local body, the following Constitution or Articles of Congregational Order this date these supplement the Articles of Incorporation and supersede any and all other rules of assembly and order not given in Scripture.</p>
    				<p>ARTICLE I. NAME</p>
    				<p>The name of this Body shall be Yeshua Light of the World Sabbath Fellowship, a Biblical Messianic Congregation in the city of Colorado Springs, the county of El Paso and the State of Colorado.</p>
    				<p>ARTICLE II. PURPOSE</p>
    				<p>Yeshua Light of the World exists for the primary purposes as given in the Tanakh and the Brit Chadashah of making disciples with the power and love of a First Century faith by:</p>
    				<p>Section1:UPREACH (Beth Tefillah House of Prayer)We reach up to God who first reached down to us by being:</p>
    				<p>a)YESHUA CENTERED in making Yeshua the Lord of our life, faith and ministry as the Messiah of Israel. We seek to make Him known in all we do believing that God revealed himself through His Son Yeshua, and that regeneration by the Spirit of God indwelling us through our trust in the person and work of Yeshua is absolutely essential as individuals and as community.<br></p>
    				<p>b)PRAYER DIRECTED through commitment to prayer corporately and as individuals for God’s leading, empowerment and blessing in all that we do (Ephesians 6:18).<br></p>
    				<p>c)WORSHIP EMPOWERED as the Body of Messiah in spirit and in truth (John 4:21-24 ), believing that worship is a testimony of our passion for Elohim (Deut. 6:5), is spiritual warfare (2 Chronicles 20:17-22) and provokes unbelievers to jealousy (Romans 11:14).<br>
    				</p>
    				<p>Section 2: INREACH (Beth Midrash House of Learning) We reach in among ourselves to build the body of Messiah through:</p>
    				<p>a) TEACHING disciples to demonstrate their love for Messiah and for Elohim by obeying His commandments as expressed in the TaNaKh and the Brit Chadeshah. We are committed to fulfilling the Messianic Mandate (Matthew 28:18-20) by expounding and strengthening our connection to our Biblical Hebraic roots which informs our faith and empowers us to communicate the truth with greater power and effectiveness.</p>
    				<p>b) SERVICE in a commitment through acts of love and service towards one another, looking to the first Messianic congregation as our model (Acts 2:42-47). We believe in the responsibility and blessing of giving tithes and offerings to God for the support of our congregation.</p>
    				<p>c) INTERDEPENDENCE by walking together in the biblical standards of holiness and righteousness, being accountable to God and to one another in the congregation and by being open to godly counsel from the wider Body of Messiah.</p>
    				<p>d) SPIRIT LED through Spirit-empowered ministry, recognizing that we are inadequate in ourselves to carry out ministry and can only exercise our spiritual gifting in the power of the Ruach haKodesh (Holy Spirit). We encourage one another to be filled and empowered daily by the Holy Spirit, operating in the gifts of the Spirit for mutual edification and the producing of lasting fruit in ministry.</p>
    				<p>Section 3: OUTREACH (Beth Besora: House of Good News) We reach out from ourselves to proclaim the truth of the Besora haGeulah, the Good News of Redemption through:</p>
    				<p>a) PROCLAMATION in both words and deeds that there is salvation in no other name than Yeshua the Messiah, the only Savior of Israel and the world.</p>
    				<p>b) RESTORATION by announcing our Hebraic heritage as found in the Tanakh and Brit Chadesah. Much of the Church has separated itself from its Hebraic roots resulting in a wrong understanding of Yeshua, weakness in the face of the world system, and a rejection of God’s instruction regarding life (Torah). We believe the Messianic congregation is at its core an expression of Jew and Gentile united into one new man (Ephesians 2:15).</p>
    				<p>ARTICLE III.  PREROGATIVES</p>
    				<p>Section 1: This congregation shall have the right to govern itself according to the standards of the Tanakh and the Brit Chadasha (the New Covenant), “endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace...till we all come in unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God (Messiah), unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Messiah,” (Ephesians 4:3,13) and in defense of the “faith once for all delivered to the saints.” (Jude 1:2).</p>
    				<p>Section 2: To have a membership which is determined by the local body and to discipline its members according to Scriptures. (Matthew 18; Romans 16:17; 1 Corinthians 5:11;2 Thessalonians 3:6,14; Titus 3:10 &amp; etc.)</p>
    				<p>Section 3: To choose, or call its spiritual leader, elect its officers, and transact all other business pertaining to its life and conduct as a local body.</p>
    				<p>Section 4: To establish and maintain such departments and institutions as may be deemed necessary for the purposes as earlier enumerated.</p>
    				<p>Section 5: To purchase, or acquire by gift, bequest, or otherwise either directly, or as trustee, and to own, hold in trust, use, sell subject to securing of a court order, convey, mortgage, lease, as allowed by state statute, or otherwise dispose of any real estate or chattels, as may be necessary for the furtherance of its purposes, all in accordance with its constitution or as the same may be hereafter modified, or amended.</p>
    				<p>ARTICLE IV.  AFFILIATION</p>
