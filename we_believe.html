    				<h2>We Believe</h2>
    				<h4 id="pdfLink">Click here for a <a href="pdf/Statement_of_Beliefs.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></h4>
    				<h3>The Creator </h3>

    				<p>We believe that there is one eternal self existing God (Elohim) who is YHVH, the Echad (Unity), who reveals himself as Abba (Father); Yeshua (Jesus) and Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) - Genesis 2:24, Deuteronomy 6:4, Proverbs 30:4, Matthew 3:16-17, Matthew 28:19; John 1:1-2, 14:18; 10:30; 14:16-17, 26; 16:7-15 and 2nd Corinthians 13:14.</p>
    				<h3>The Scriptures </h3>
    				<p>We believe that the TaNaKh or Hebrew Bible made of the Torah, Nebiʼim and Ketubim - the Torah, Prophets and Writings (aka The First Testament or”Old” Testament) is the “all Scripture” referred to in 2 Timothy 3:16-17 as this was the only Scripture available when this text was written; and the B'rit Chadashah (The New Testament, rightly, the Testament of the Torah written on our hearts - Jeremiah 31): are completely and irrevocably the Word of Elohim, the will of the Creator and that it is eternal and will not pass away Isaiah 40:8; 1 Peter 1:23; Matthew 5:18; Luke 16:17; that must not be added to or subtracted from Deuteronomy 4:2, 12:32; Proverbs 30:5-6; and is to be lived in its entirety rather than as a buffet of personal choice Joshua 1:8-9; John 14:23-24; 1 John 5:2-6.<br>
      					<br>
      					We believe that the Torah (properly teaching) which contains but does not equal the Law of God is profitable Psalm 19:8-11 and is indivisible Deuteronomy 8:1; 11:8,22 (where it reads kol hamitsvah = all the commandment) 1 Timothy 6:14; that it is eternal and applies today Matthew 5:16-19. That there is one Torah for all who would seek to follow the God of the Bible Exodus 12:48-49; Exodus 20:8-10; Exodus 22:21-23; Exodus 23:9-12; Leviticus 16:29-31; Leviticus 17:8-10; Leviticus 17:15-16; Leviticus 18:26; 29-30; Leviticus 19:33-34; Leviticus 22:18-19; Leviticus 24:16; Leviticus 25:22; Numbers 9:14; Numbers 15:13-16; Numbers 15:25-30; Numbers 19:10-12; Deuteronomy 1:16-17; Deuteronomy 5:12-14; Deuteronomy 16:10-15; Deuteronomy 26:9-11; Deuteronomy 29:10-15; and Deuteronomy 31:12-13 and that ritual conversion to Judaism did not exist until the second century CE and the Torah is silent on this matter.</p>

    				<h3>The Messiah </h3>
    				<p>We believe that Yeshua of Nazareth is the seed of the Woman prophesied in Genesis 3:15, and that He is the prophet spoken of by Moses, Deuteronomy 18:15, 18 and the greatest prophet of Israel - Matthew 24. He is YHVH who appeared among mankind in the flesh, Gen. 4:1 (see hebrew!); John 1:1-2, 14; 1 John 4:1-3; that He died for our sin Isaiah 53:5-6; John 1:29; 1 Peter 2:24, 3:18; and was buried and rose on the third day; Psalm 16:10, Acts 2:27; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:18-19, and now is glorified with all power in Heaven and in Earth Matthew 28:18 at the right hand of the Father Ephesians 1:20-21. We believe He is the Great High Priest of our confession-Hebrews 3:1, and has an eternal High Priesthood as Priest-King in the line of Melchizedek-Psalm 110:4, and Hebrews 5:10. We believe that Yeshua is the King of Kings, Lord of Lords and Sar Shalom(Prince of Peace)-Isaiah 9:6, Revelation 19:16. the Word of God made flesh - Matthew 5:17, John 1:1, and that Yeshua is the Aleph and Tav, the Alpha and Omega, of the Word of God- Isaiah 41:4; 44:6; 48:12; Revelation 1:11-17, and Revelation 21:6.<br>
      					<br>
      					We believe in the atoning blood of Yeshua-Leviticus 17:11, Isaiah 53:10, and Hebrews 9:22. We believe that Yeshua is the only way to the Abba-Father-John 14:6, that there's no other name by which we can saved, delivered, healed, forgiven and receive eternal life-Acts 4:12, 1st Timothy 2:5 and that He alone is the life-giver who gives life abundantly and eternally.John 14:6, John 10:10, John 3:16.<br>
      					<br>
      					We believe that Yeshua was fully human and divine while on earth, Colossians 2:9, was born of a virgin: Isaiah 9:7, that He is the Mashiach Ben Yoseph (Messiah Son of Joseph, suffering Messiah) in Isaiah 53, and is returning as Mashiach Ben David(Messiah Son of David, the conquering Messiah) at the end of this present age - Revelation 19:11-16, Revelation 5:5.</p>

    				<h3>The Ruach (Spirit)</h3>
    				<p>We believe that the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) came upon individuals during the times of our forefathers, such as Moses, David, and the Prophets, for specific purposes as revealed in the TaNaKh. We believe that since the resurrection of Messiah, the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit), in all that He does, glorifies the Lord Yeshua the Messiah (John 16:13-15). He convicts mankind regarding sin, righteousness and judgment (John 16:8). He regenerates and indwells sinners, and in Him they are baptized into union with Messiah (1 Corinthians 12:13) are sealed with the Spirit (Ephesians 1:13; 4:30; 2 Corinthians 1:21) and adopted as heirs into the family of God (Romans 8:14-15). He also, fills, illuminates, guides, equips and empowers believers for living like Messiah and for service (Ephesians 5:17-21). We believe in the present operation of the gifts and fruit of the Spirit according to 1st Corinthians 12, Romans 12, Ephesians 4 and Galatians 5:22.</p>

    				<h3>Mankind </h3>
    				<p>We believe that every human is born under the dominion of sin and needs a Savior, the first humans being conceived and born following the sin of Adam and Chava, Genesis 4, Psalm 51:5; 1st Kings 8:46, Ecclesiastes 7:20, Proverbs 20:9, Romans 3:23 and that without forgiveness by the blood of Yeshua, everyone is doomed for the lake of fire-Romans 6:23, John 3:36, Revelations 21:15. We believe that every human being has an adversary (haSatan) whose desire is to steal, kill and destroy- John 10:10. We believe that through the blood of Yeshua, we have overcome the devil-Revelation 12:10, Luke 10:17-19. 1st John 4:4, 1st John 5:18 and that the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us- Matthew 16:18 and that haSatan and all those who rebel against God and Yeshua shall find their place in the Lake of Fire- Isaiah 66:Revelations 20:10, 14, and, 15.</p>

    				<h3>Salvation </h3>
    				<p>We believe that all who turn away from sin and live according to God's message of salvation in the Messiah are born anew by the Spirit of God. Faith in the Messiah as the mediator of the New Covenant makes us true children of God; John 1:11-13 and results in the Spirit writing the Torah of God on our hearts Jeremiah 31:31-33; causing us to walk according to His Word Ezekiel 36:24-27. We believe that salvation is by faith only, that faith is evidenced by our good works 2 Timothy 3:16 or works of righteousness - Ephesians 2:11-12, James 1:22, James 2:17, and Galatians 5:25. We believe that all who experience salvation whether non-Jews or Jews, have been grafted together into the Olive Tree of Israel Romans 11:18 and Acts 15 and together have become One New Man in Messiah Ephesians 2:12-14 in the worship of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the Creator.</p>

    				<h3>Tevilah, Immersion </h3>
    				<p>We believe in Mikvah (water baptism by whole body immersion) according to Matthew 28:19, and that all believers should be immersed as evidence of their faith in Yeshua, and the symbolism of the death of the old nature and the birth of the new-Mark 16:15-16, Romans 6:4, Ephesians 4:22-24, Acts 8:36-39. Immersion in mikveh is not a new practice invented by the Talmidim of Yeshua but is an application of the practice of marking a distinction of preparedness for service and for coming into the presence of God.</p>

    				<h3>The Sabbath </h3>
    				<p>We believe that Saturday is the Sabbath of God, commencing Friday evening to Saturday evening, according to the pattern of a day in scripture- Genesis 1:5; and the marking of the seventh day Genesis 2:1-3. God sanctified, rested and refreshed himself on the Sabbath Genesis 2:1-3, Exodus 20:9-11. We believe that the command to sanctify the Sabbath was never changed to Sunday by God but was changed by the tradition of the church elders. Yeshua kept the Sabbath, Luke 4:16 and if we are to walk as He walked, 1 John 2:3-6, we should also keep the Sabbath. We do not judge brethren who worship on Sunday or any other day, but that day is not the day biblically set aside for the Worship of God.</p>

    				<h3>The Lordʼs Days </h3>
    				<p>We believe the people of YHVH are a holy Miqra, a congregation or called out assembly (Ekklesia), which is not of this world, in order to gather and celebrate Him at His appointed holy Feasts (Pesach, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Shavuot, Yom Teruah, Yon haKippurim, Succoth) to shine as lights of truth in the darkness of this present age, and to be a royal priesthood which praises His Name Exodus 19:6, Leviticus 23, Matthew 16:18, 1 Peter 2:9. We believe that we are to keep the Feasts of the Lord, according to Leviticus 23, and that the Spring Festivals (Pesach, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Shavuot) are kept as memorials, having been fulfilled by Mashiach Yeshua and the Fall Festivals (Yom Teruah, Yom haKippurim, Succoth) as ”rehearsals” waiting for their final fulfillment in Yeshuaʼs return - Hebrews 10:1; Leviticus 23:2, Colossians 2:16-17. Followers of Messiah are warned against being captured by human philosophy, deception, manʼs traditions and the basic principles of the world Colossians 2:8 and therefore should let no one but the Body of Messiah judge them in their keeping of Godʼs appointed times Leviticus 23:2; Colossians 2:16-17.</p>

    				<h3>The Nation and Land of Yisrael </h3>
    				<p>We believe that the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish Nation deeded to them by God - Genesis 15:18-21, and that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish nation. We believe that the time is coming when the remnant of his brethren, the Jewish Nation, will recognize Yeshua according to Zechariah 12:10, and acknowledge him as their Messiah, and that Yeshua is waiting for the time when the Jewish people will say to him: “Baruch Haba Bashem YHVH” - Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord”- Psalm 118:26, Matthew 23:29 and Matthew 21:9 and that this recognition will be life from the dead Romans 11:15. We believe that non-Jews owe a debt of gratitude to the Jewish people for preserving the Word of God and setting themselves apart unto God so the Messiah would be born from them providing the World with Salvation-Romans 3:1-2, Romans 9:4-5.<br>
      					We believe that there's a special blessing on non-Jews who bless the Jewish people-Genesis 12:3, and Psalm 122:6. We completely reject the demonic teaching of replacement theology, that the “Church”; has replaced Israel. The Word Israel, is used over 70 times in the Brit Chadeshah, new testament, and continually refers to the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and not “the church.”.</p>
    				<p id="bottomStatement"><strong>Yeshua Light of the World</strong> is a Sabbath fellowship of disciples (talmidim), who seek to view all Scripture through the eyes of Yeshua our Jewish Rabbi. Scripture clearly teaches to take hold of the hem of the Jew (Zech 8:23) and seek the instruction (Torah) of The Creator and learn His ways (Isaiah 2:2-3). We are commanded to hold to no other teacher (Rabbi) than Yeshua (Matt 23:8) and to follow his teaching by living (walking) in the same manner as he walked (1 John 2:6). Join us as disciples of Yeshua while we learn to keep the Sabbath, the Feasts of the Creator, and a daily life that rediscovers the biblical Hebraic foundations of our faith while keeping !Messiah central to our life and worship. We follow the biblical calendar of the New Moon (rosh chodesh) in determining the Appointed Times (moed&rsquo;im) of The Creator (Elohim) and are developing a Yeshua centered way of our faith that is neither an imitation of the modern church or synagogue but the goal of living in a first century faith for twenty first century life. </p>
